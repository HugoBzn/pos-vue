# pos-vue

This project works as a point of sale, where you can buy clothes, this works with an admin panel without log in and we can see the products and we can create, delete and modify. 👕 👟 🕶️

This project is a Fullstack Project, working with Firestore and Vue 3 (Composition API).

This project is using Vue-router 🛣️, Pinia 🍍, Composables 📈, Firestore 🔥, Vuefire 💚, TailwindCSS 💙.

This idea is from a course made it by Juan de la Torre (Udemy) 🤓.
